Welcome to the University of Ghana Computer Science Department website. I created this website as a project to showcase my skils and knowledge in web development. The website features various pages about the computer science departmnet and also to demonstrate different aspects of web design and development. 
This website can also serve as hub for students, faculty or students to access information about the computer science department.

# Clone and Setup of Project
1. First and foremost, I forked the original/main repository of the project on github into my personal repository on github. The code link for the original repository is copied.

3. Once the cloning of the project is done, navigate into the project directory.
