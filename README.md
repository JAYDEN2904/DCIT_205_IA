This README provides an overview of the website, including setup instructions, author information, screenshots, and lessons learned.

# Introduction
Welcome to the University of Ghana Computer Science Department website. I created this website as a project to showcase my skils and knowledge in web development. The website features various pages about the computer science departmnet and also to demonstrate different aspects of web design and development. 
This website can also serve as hub for students, faculty or students to access information about the computer science department.

# Clone and Setup of Project
1. First and foremost, I forked the original/main repository of the project on github into my personal repository on github. The code link for the original repository is copied.
2. Open your VS code IDE or any other IDE and open a new folder. In order for you to clone a repository the "git clone" command is used in addition to the code link of that repository. Once a folder you want to use for your project is opened, open the terminal and navigate to th directory where you wan to clone th project. The following command is run:
git clone https://
3. Once the cloning of the project is done, navigate into the project directory.
4. Create an html file of your choice in your IDE(i.e index.html), and open the file in web browser to view the website.

# Lessons Learned
The project was challenging as it required a lot of time and effort to complete. This project has helped me to learn valuable skills in HTML,CSS,Javascript and responsive web design which will help me in real-world projects. The project also helped me gain experience in building or creating a professional website and how to manage the development of the website from start to finish. This project has also helped me to gain much needed knowledge about github and all that it entails. I have been able to learn various git commands which makes maanging of code easier.

Thank you for visiting my website.
